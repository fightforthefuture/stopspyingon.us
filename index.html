We need to seize this moment, no matter how you feel about Trump, and do everything we can to get him to veto this bill that expands mass surveillance powers that are too dangerous for any president to have. Copy and paste any of these messages to tweet. </p>

                         <li>Please veto S. 139 @realDonaldTrump. Congress’ bill fails to include privacy reforms, allowing the government to continue to spy on our phone calls, emails, and text messages without a warrant! #VetoCongress</li>
                         
<li>Please veto S. 139 @realDonaldTrump. Congress’ FISA reauthorization bill isn’t just controversial, it’s unconstitutional (it lets the U.S. government spy on Americans without a warrant)! #VetoCongress</li>
<li>Veto Congress’ FISA reauthorization bill @realDonaldTrump. Do not let Congress pass a law that lets the government spy on Americans without a warrant. #VetoCongress</li>
                         
<li>Veto Congress’ FISA reauthorization bill @realDonaldTrump. This unconstitutional bill violates the Fourth Amendment and expands the government’s warrantless spying powers. Only you can stop it now. #VetoCongress</li>
<li>Congress’ FISA bill is BAD. It grants the government unconstitutional powers to spy on Americans without a warrant. Veto this bill @realDonaldTrump, and tell Congress to try again. #VetoCongress</li>
<li>The American people do not want 6 more years of unconstitutional government spying powers. #VetoCongress’ FISA bill @realDonaldTrump </li>

                <p>In the age of federal misconduct, members of Congress should be ashamed to extend the government's power to collect information on and then target Americans, all without a warrant.

            </h2>
            <p>
                FISA was originally passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks to
                allow the military to spy on the communications of foreign terrorists. Since then,
                whistleblowers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Revelations" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a> and <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-sues-fbi-records-removal-former-deputy-assistant-director-peter-strzok-mueller-operation/" target="_blank">Judicial Watch</a> have revealed that the
                executive branch has abused FISA with numerous exceptions, carve-outs, and
                "creative interpretations," allowing agencies like the FBI, NSA, and the president
                to spy on Americans without a warrant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ironically, the vote hinged on Democratic lawmakers and now it's up to the President to stop it. After more than a year of
                relentlessly calling Donald Trump a fascist, an authoritarian, and even comparing
                him to Adolph Hitler, Democrats are on the verge of giving Trump six more years
                of unrestricted mass surveillance authority. Meanwhile, Republicans have alleged
                that President Obama abused FISA to improperly spy on the Trump campaign with no
                civilian oversight. Democrat or Republican, no president should
                have this authority.
